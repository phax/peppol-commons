## peppol-id-datatypes

Java library with the JAXB generated elements for Peppol ID and Peppol Code List handling.
First created in v8.4.0.

Make sure to run `mvn process-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

## peppol-id

Java library with shared IDs and predefined IDs.
First created in v7.0.0.

## peppol-commons

Java library with shared Peppol components. It contains the basic algorithms. Since v7 this depends on the `peppol-id` submodule.

This project also contains the predefined Peppol Truststores. See https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons/tree/master/peppol-commons/src/main/resources/truststore for all details.

## peppol-sbdh

Simple SBDH handler for the use with Peppol.
It offers the possibility to extract all meta data from an SBDH document as well as 
set all meta data to an SBDH document.

Make sure to run `mvn generate-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

This projects implements the "Envelope specification" as listed on
http://www.peppol.eu/ressource-library/technical-specifications/transport-infrastructure/infrastructure-resources.
The detail document this project refers to can be found at
https://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/envelope/PEPPOL-EDN-Business-Message-Envelope-1.2.1-2020-03-11.pdf

## peppol-testfiles

A Java library with a lot of UBL and SBDH test files suitable for different scenarios.  

SimpleInvoicing test files are used from https://github.com/SimplerInvoicing/testset

## peppol-sml-client

This project contains the SML client library used by the SMP's to interact with the SML.
This library is usually only used within SMP servers, to communicate the changes to the central SML.

Make sure to run `mvn generate-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

This project contains 2 main classes for talking to the Peppol SML:
  * `ManageServiceMetadataServiceCaller` which is used to change SMP assignments in the SML. This must be called for a new SMP to register it once at the SML.
  * `ManageParticipantIdentifierServiceCaller` which is used to manage the assignment of participants to SMPs. This must be invoked from the SMP server every time a new participant is registered (or an existing one is modified or deleted).
  
Both classes offer the possibility to set an optional custom `SSLSocketFactory` as well as a custom optional `HostnameVerifier`. The implementation of this is in the base class `AbstractSMLClientCaller`.

This project is used by [peppol-smp-server](https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server/) the SMP server with a management GUI and flexible backends.

## peppol-smp-datatypes

Java library with the JAXB generated elements for Peppol SMP handling.
First created in v8.4.0.

Make sure to run `mvn process-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

## peppol-smp-client

This project holds the SMP client library used by the Access Points to retrieve service metadata. 
This project supports the Peppol SMP specification, the OASIS BDXR SMP v1 and OASIS BDXR SMP v2 specification. 
This project uses Apache HTTP client to perform the REST lookups on foreign SMPs.

The Peppol SMP specification 1.2.0, mandatory per 1.5.2022, is supported since v8.7.3.

I also provide an OSS [phoss SMP server](https://github.com/phax/phoss-smp) with a nice management GUI.

### Configuration

**Configuration resolution (since v8.2.0)**

The SMP client (both Peppol and OASIS BDXR) uses the file `application.properties` for configuration.
The file `smp-client.properties` is also evaluated for backwards-compatibility reasons but with lower priority.

See https://github.com/phax/ph-commons#ph-config for the new resolution logic.

**Configuration resolution (pre v8.2.0)**

The SMP client (both Peppol and OASIS BDXR) uses the file `smp-client.properties` for configuration. The default file resides in the folder `src/main/resources` of this project. You can change the path of the properties file by setting the environment variable `SMP_CLIENT_CONFIG` (since v7.0.7), the system property `peppol.smp.client.properties.path` (since v4.3.5), the system property `smp.client.properties.path` (available as of v4.2.0) to the absolute path of the configuration file (e.g. by specifying `-Dsmp.client.properties.path=/var/www/smpclient.properties` on Java startup). The name of the file does not matter, but if you specify a different properties file please make sure that you also specify an absolute path to e.g. the trust store!

**Configuration properties**

It supports the following properties:
* **`smpclient.truststore.type`**: the type of key store to be used. Possible values are `JKS`, `PKCS12` and `BCFKS`. Defaults to `JKS`.
* **`smpclient.truststore.path`**: the location of the Peppol trust store (of the specified type) to be used. If this property is not defined, the value defaults to `truststore/complete-truststore.jks`. By default the SMP client supports the following built-in trust stores (in library [peppol-commons](https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons)):
    * `truststore/complete-truststore.jks` - contains the trust certificates for Peppol production and pilot (root, AP, SMP, Directory, SML)
    * `truststore/2018/smp-prod-truststore.jks` - contains the trust certificates for Peppol production only (root, SMP, Directory, SML)
    * `truststore/2018/smp-pilot-truststore.jks` - contains the trust certificates for Peppol pilot only (root, SMP, Directory, SML)
* **`smpclient.truststore.password`**: the password to access the trust store. By default the password `peppol` is used. This password is valid for all built-in trust stores mentioned above.

* **`http.proxy.host`** (before v8.7.2: **`http.proxyHost`**): the host name or IP address to be used as a HTTP proxy for **all** hosts. If you need proxy exemptions than the `http.useSystemProperties` is the configuration item of choice.
* **`http.proxy.port`** (before v8.7.2: **`http.proxyPort`**): the port of the HTTP proxy. The port must be specified and has no default value! If you need proxy exemptions than the `http.useSystemProperties` is the configuration item of choice.
* **`http.proxy.username`** (before v8.7.2: **`http.proxyUsername`**): the username for the HTTP proxy. This property takes only effect if proxy host and proxy port are defined. 
* **`http.proxy.password`** (before v8.7.2: **`http.proxyPassword`**): the password for the HTTP proxy. This property takes only effect if proxy host, proxy port and proxy username are defined.
* **`http.proxy.nonProxyHosts`** (before v8.7.2: **`http.nonProxyHosts`**) (since v6.2.4): A pipe separated list of non-proxy hosts. E.g. `localhost|127.0.0.1`.
* [deprecated since v8.7.2] **`http.useSystemProperties`** (since v5.2.4): if `true` the system properties (=JVM properties) for HTTP configuration are used for setting up the connection. This implies that the properties `http.proxyHost`, `http.proxyPort`, `http.proxyUsername` and `http.proxyPassword` are ineffective! The default value is `false`. Deprecated since v8.7.2
* **`http.connect.timeout.ms`** (since v7.0.4): set the connect timeout in milliseconds. The default value is `5000` meaning 5 seconds.
* **`http.response.timeout.ms`** (since v8.8.0; before **`http.request.timeout.ms`**): set the response timeout in milliseconds. The default value is `10000` meaning 10 seconds.

### Specifying a proxy server

A proxy server can be specified in two ways:
* A single proxy server for **all** hosts - no exemptions. This can be specified in the configuration file for all `SMPClient` instances or per `SMPClient` instance (same for BDXR client - for all clients based on `AbstractGenericSMPClient`).
* A more complex setup based on the JVM system properties (based on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html). This can also be specified in the configuration file to enable the usage for all `SMPClient` instances or on a per-instance basis.

**Specify a global proxy server**
The SMP client supports a proxy server. By default the proxy specified in the configuration file (see above) is used (since v4.3.0).

Alternatively call the method `setProxy (org.apache.http.HttpHost)` on an `SMPClient` or `SMPClientReadOnly`. This means you can specify the proxy on a per-call basis.
Proxy authentication is available since v5.2.5 by invoking `setProxyCredentials (org.apache.http.auth.Credentials)` on the SMP or BDXR client.

**Using the JVM system properties (deprecated)**

This property is deprecated as of v8.7.2 and will be removed in v9.

Since v5.2.2 the method `SMPClient.setUseProxySystemProperties (true)` can be used to enable the usage of the default system properties for HTTP connections (see the section on the configuration file for details). Since v5.2.4 the configuration file property `http.useSystemProperties` can be used to achieve the same without code changes. By enabling the usage of the system properties, the manually set proxy is ignored; if a proxy is manually set after this setting, it disables the usage of the system properties again.
Note: this of course works for both SMP and BDXR client.

Supported system properties are (based on Apache HTTPClient):
  * `ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStore`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStoreProvider`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword`
  * `ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreProvider`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword`
  * `https.protocols`
  * `https.cipherSuites`
  * `http.proxyHost`
  * `http.proxyPort`
  * `http.nonProxyHosts`
  * `http.keepAlive`
  * `http.maxConnections`
  * `http.agent`
  
### Example usage

Get the endpoint URL for a participant using a special document type and process:

```java
    // The Peppol participant identifier
    final PeppolParticipantIdentifier aPI_AT_Test = PeppolParticipantIdentifier.createWithDefaultScheme ("9915:test");

    // Create the main SMP client using the production SML
    final SMPClientReadOnly aSMPClient = new SMPClientReadOnly (PeppolURLProvider.INSTANCE,
                                                                aPI_AT_Test,
                                                                ESML.DIGIT_TEST);
    final String sEndpointAddress = aSMPClient.getEndpointAddress (aPI_AT_Test,
                                                                   EPredefinedDocumentTypeIdentifier.INVOICE_EN16931_PEPPOL_V30,
                                                                   EPredefinedProcessIdentifier.BIS3_BILLING,
                                                                   ESMPTransportProfile.TRANSPORT_PROFILE_PEPPOL_AS4_V2);
    // Endpoint address should be "https://test.erechnung.gv.at/as4"
    System.out.println ("The Austrian government test AS4 AP that handles invoices in Peppol BIS 3 is located at: " +
                        sEndpointAddress);
```

If you don't need the DNS lookup you can use the URL of the SMP directly (equivalent to the previous example):

```java
    // The Peppol participant identifier
    final PeppolParticipantIdentifier aPI_AT_Test = PeppolParticipantIdentifier.createWithDefaultScheme ("9915:test");

    // Create the main SMP client using the production SML
    final SMPClientReadOnly aSMPClient = new SMPClientReadOnly (URLHelper.getAsURI ("http://B-85008b8279e07ab0392da75fa55856a2.iso6523-actorid-upis.acc.edelivery.tech.ec.europa.eu"));
    final String sEndpointAddress = aSMPClient.getEndpointAddress (aPI_AT_Test,
                                                                   EPredefinedDocumentTypeIdentifier.INVOICE_EN16931_PEPPOL_V30,
                                                                   EPredefinedProcessIdentifier.BIS3_BILLING,
                                                                   ESMPTransportProfile.TRANSPORT_PROFILE_PEPPOL_AS4_V2);

    // Endpoint address should be "https://test.erechnung.gv.at/as4"
    System.out.println ("The Austrian government test AS4 AP that handles invoices in Peppol BIS 3 is located at: " +
                        sEndpointAddress);
```

# Building from source

This project is meant to be build by Maven 3.x.
It requires at least Java 1.8 to be build.
To build simply call `mvn clean install` in the root folder.

When integrating this in your IDE, ensure to run `mvn process-sources` first, so that the automatically generated files are present.
For the subprojects `peppol-id`, `peppol-commons`, `peppol-sbdh` and `peppol-sml-client` add `target/generated-sources/xjc` to your buildpath afterwards.

# Maven usage

Add the following to your pom.xml to use this artifact, replacing `x.y.z` with the latest version number (see below):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-id</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-commons</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-testfiles</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-sbdh</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-sml-client</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-smp-client</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively use the following code in your `dependencyManagement` section to use it as a BOM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-commons-parent-pom</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

Note: prior to v8.1.0 the Maven groupId was `com.helger`.

The binary version of this library can be found on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/helger/peppol/ 
They depend on several other libraries so I suggest you are going for the Maven source integration.
