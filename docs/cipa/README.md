# CIPA 2.2.3
As the original CIPA SVN is no longer available, because of the Joinup platform update in October 2017,
a ZIPed copy of the SVN tag 2.2.3 was added to this repository for comparison.

CIPA e-Delivery became CEF eDelivery and the development now happens on a Git repository.
All versions prior to 3.x were not converted.

*Note:* 2.1.0 was the first 2.x version so I added it for comparison.
Later versions (2.3.x or later) are too big (ZIPed SVN tag > 300MB) so I spared them.
